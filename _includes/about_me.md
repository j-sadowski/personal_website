I am a data science and technology leader with an ability to turn AI/ML solutions into business value. With a strong background in machine learning (binary classification, computer vision), data analytics (experimental statistics), data engineering (MLOps), and cloud optimization (GCP, Azure, Kubernetes), I've successfully led cross-functional teams to automate ML workflows and reduce infrastructure costs.
